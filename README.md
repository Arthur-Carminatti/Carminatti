ðŸ”¥ Hello, welcome to my profile! My name is Arthur and my goal here is to update my portfolio with my most recent projects. I believe that the pursuit of knowledge should never stop and I am always looking to learn more to develop professionally. I am passionate about technology and have mainly focused on front-end development, but I also have knowledge in back-end, which allows me to have a broad and integrated vision of projects. My English is intermediate and I am always looking to improve it to better communicate with international teams. I am open to opportunities that challenge me and allow me to grow as a professional. If you are interested in learning more about me or working together, please do not hesitate to contact me. It will be a pleasure to talk to you!

âš¡ I am constantly striving to improve my skills and knowledge in the field of technology. Currently, I am dedicating my time and energy to learning various languages and tools such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, ReactJS, TypeScript, SQL, Git, and GitHub. I believe that staying up-to-date with trends and demands in the job market is essential, which is why I am always looking to learn more. Additionally, I am applying my knowledge to personal projects and freelance work to consolidate my skills and develop practical experience.
